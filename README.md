1st project: arduino music gesture control, tried something different with the next/prev song and it recognizing whether or not to keep going, things like volume up and down were already done and I wanted to try something a little different.

In order to fast forward through songs, do the same command of next song but push your hand down. Same goes for going through songs in the opposite direction.
